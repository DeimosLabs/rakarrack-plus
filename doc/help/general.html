<p>RAKARRACK is a multi-effect processor for guitar players but the
signal processing engine allows a full range of parameter adjustment
making it suitable for almost any audio processing task.
Thirty-two effects are included in this version: Lineal EQ, Parametric EQ,
Shuffle, Exciter, Compressor,Expander, Distortion, Overdrive, Derelict, DistBand, Echo,
MusicalDelay, Arpie, Chorus, Phaser, Analog Phaser, Flanger, Dual Flange, Reverb, WahWah, AlienWah,
MuTroMojo, Convolotron, Cabinet, Valve, AutoPan/Extra Stereo, Harmonizer, Noise Gate, Ring, Synthfilter, 
VaryBand and Looper. Ten can be used simultaneously on a chain. Also has a Tuner and a monophonic MIDI Converter. 
Rakarrack can be managed externally by MIDI, the program receive Program Change and the parameters 
can be controlled via Control Change MIDI messages.</p>

<p>One of the most important things of RAKARRACK is that everything
is on a single mouse click. All the effect parameters are on the
screen.</p>

<p>The effects are processed on a chain, the chain order processing
is fully configurable by the user for each preset. The preset saves
all the effects parameters. These presets can be grouped into banks
to manage more efficiently. Saving a preset is as easy as typing a
name.</p>

<p>Rakarrack is capable of generating high volume output. It has Gain
controls in general and some of the effects allow high gain
adjustments. Use these gains with caution because they can produce
unwanted effects. However, a limiter is applied to the final output
which prevents signal level from increasing beyond 0dB. Bear this in
mind, for high gains triggering limiting in the output will initiate
high-ratio hard-knee compression. This is better than hard clipping
distortion, but the audio effect can be undesirable.</p>

<p align="left">Rakarrack is a JACK application, Dave Phillips wrote
some good articles in their blog of how to use Linux audio with jack,
if you don't know about jack, or you have problems running rakarrack,
please read this series of articles:</p>

<h3>INSTALL</h3>

<p>Please read the INSTALL, README and PACKAGERS.README files provided
with rakarrack. You will find there a  list of required dependency
packages and detailed configuration options.</p>



<h3>Warning</h3>


<p>From 0.5.0 version we have included resampling and convolotron
effect, the quality and amount settings of resampling must be set with
extremely care, because they use a lot of CPUresources, in fact most
computers can't afford the "Best" resampling quality if the amount of
resampling is "x4" or greater. The resampling process makes each effect use
more CPU resources because need to process more samples, if you combine
wrong settings with convolotron or harmonizer effects that use also a lot CPU resources the results can be
unpredictable. Wrong settings can hang up you computer. You have been warned.
</p>

<p>Of course resampling increase the sound quality, the way to set up
is start with the worst resampling settings, amount = "x2" and
Quality "Linear", the the jack load CPU value is displayed in the
status bar in the preset block, if you want more accurate CPU usage
values use top, htop or
other CPU monitors, then increase the values thinking that then next
step of quality could use double CPU than the actual set, that's not
exactly in the lower resampling quality levels, but is more or
less accurate in the high levels. You need to find a good balance
between amount and quality settings to obtain the better sound that
your computer can afford. Don't forget that each effect use also more
CPU with resampling, then the best to set the resampling settings is
using a preset that has five or six effects.
</p>

<p>Convolotron has a "Safe Mode" parameter, that "magically" limits the
length of the Impulse Response file read, this is safe because limit
the CPU usage, this maximum length is calculated reading the bogomips,
is not dynamic and don't measure other tasks that your computer may be
performing. We have been careful to calculate this maximum value, but
if you use resampling this "safe" value can be ridiculous and may cause
depending of the Impulse Response file read that the convolotron
effect don't has sound, that can happens if the value is less than 5 ms.</p>

<p>Of course increasing the length parameter you will obtain a better
convolotron sound, if you unset the "Safe Mode" you can set the length
to a desired value without the magical limit, but do that with
extremely care. Check the jack load CPU in the status bar or use a CPU monitor to see what
your computer can afford. Do that with small steps and checking the CPU
usage, or you will hang up your computer. You have been warned.</p>

<h3><a name="conn"></a>Connecting</h3>

<p>The connections shown in the screenshot correspond to a
motherboard sound card. The guitar is connected to the input line.
Obviously this configuration can vary depending of your sound card.
RAKARRACK has two inputs to allow use of stereo devices. The
screenshot shows the connection of a guitar, usually mono aural.</p>

<p><img src="imagenes/jack_conections.jpg" alt="rakarrack Qjackctl Connect" align="bottom" border="1" height="313" vspace="10" width="562"></p>

<h3><a name="pyb"></a>Presets &amp; Banks</h3>

<p>The state of the rack can be saved to a file at any
time, either pressing the "Save" buttons or via the menu
File-&gt;Save Preset. Rakarrack suggest the preset name for the
filename.rkr in the save operation, but you can put what you want.
You can assign the preset name here:</p>

<p><img src="imagenes/preset_name1.png" alt="rakarrack Preset Box"></p>

<p>If the user modifies any preset bank, The "compare"
button allows you to compare the sound of the current state of
rakarrack with the original bank preset from which it departed.</p>

<p>You can use banks to store groups of presets. 80 preset can be
saved on a bank. To include a preset in a bank must first indicate
the name of preset on the main screen, open the bank window and click
on a empty slot with the right mouse button. To retrieve a preset
stored in a bank must open the window of banks and clicking the left
button on the preset desired, also you can use the Preset selector of
the main window.</p>

<p>To save a preset in a bank:</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>Put descriptive name to the preset</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open the bank window (B)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Press the <b>right mouse button</b> in a empty place OR</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Press the <b>right mouse button</b> on an existing preset if
you wish to overwrite it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To retrieve a preset from a bank:</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>Open the bank window (B)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <b>left mouse button</b> on the preset</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When rakarrack starts always load the bank selected in <a href="#settings">preferences</a>
unless you specify another bank in the <a href="#cmd">command line</a>.
Of course you can load/save any bank via menu File. By default, is
allocated in preferences the installation included bank. This bank
("Default.rkrb") is installed with root properties, then
you can't overwrite as user. But is easy to save in any place to work
with it. The bank contains default presets developed by <a href="#autores">the
development team and some friends</a> who have contributed in this
facet.</p>
<p>Two banks are released with rakarrack, Default.rkrb and Extra.rkrb, they are
installed in the data directory selected in the configure process
normally in "/usr/share/rakarrack" or "/usr/local/share/rakarrack".</p>


<p><img src="imagenes/bank_mgmt.jpg" alt="rakarrack Bank Window" align="bottom" border="1" height="500" width="640"></p>

<p>Up the Bank windows screenshot, the tittle bar show
the loaded bank. Click on preset or use preset counter in the Preset
section to change the preset.</p>

<p>Presets marked with (*) use the Select mode in the
Harmonizer effect, that means you need to play a monophonic melody in
the Key/Chord selected. The harmonizer recognizes what note you play
and creates a second voice in the Key/Chord selected.</p>

<h2>Audio Preferences</h2>

<p><img alt="Settings Audio" src="imagenes/settings1.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Fx On at start</b></p>
<p>This option put the FX On at the start, by default
is Off.</p>
<p><b>Filter Input DC Offset</b></p>
<p>DC Input Removal, if you have a "cheapo" soundcard enable it</p> 
<p><b>Preserve Gain/Master</b></p>
<p>The Input Gain and Master Volume are stored in the
preset, activating this option the Input Level and Master Volume was
not modified when preset changes</p>

<p><b>Update Tap Tempo</b></p>
<p>If enabled each time you change the preset the Tempo
parameter on the effects that has the "On" state will be updated with the
Tap Tempo value/settings</p>

<p><b>Upsampling</b></p>
<p>Enable upsampling using libsamplerate process the
effects with higher sample rate then the sound quality is improved, all
the resample parameters will take effect the next time you launch
rakarrack. Enabling upsampling rakarrack will use a lot more CPU
resources of your computer, then take care to adjust all the upsampling
settings, you can hang your computer if your main processor can not
handle the resampling parameters. Each level of libsamplerate quality
use more and more resources, and of course each effect use more CPU
resources because need to process a higher amount of data. I highly
recommend start with Linear quality and amount "x2" and check your CPU
usage with "top", and then increase the amount/quality as desired.</p>

<p><b>Amount</b></p>
<p>Amount of resampling (x2, x3, x4, x5, x6)</p>

<p><b>Up Sampling Quality</b></p>
<p>Upsampling quality, select the libsamplerate quality
for the upsampling procedure.</p>

<p><b>Down Sampling Quality</b></p>
<p>Downsampling quality, select the libsamplerate quality for the downsampling procedure.</p>

<p><b>Looper Size Seconds</b></p>
<p>Is the size in seconds of the buffer for the Looper effect.</p>

<p><b>Harmonizer Quality</b></p>
<p>Selects the quality of the harmonizer audio
engine, used by Harmonizer, Shifter and Sequence effects, the available
values are "4,8,16,32", the default value is "4". Incrementing the quality
increments the CPU usage by this effect. Take specially care if you are
using resampling too.
This parameter will take effect the next time you run rakarrack.</p>

<p><b>Limiter before Output Volume</b></p>
<p> Rakarrack use a invisible end chain Limiter to limit the output signal
level, this option put the limiter before the Output Volume slider, use that
iff you need to generate a saturated signal level.</p>

<p><b> Harmonizer, Reverbtron, Convolotron, Sequence and Shifter
Downsample</b></p>
<p> Here you can select the sample rate that use each effect, if you have
problems of CPU usage, use this options to reduce the amount of CPU that
each effect use. Probably if you have active resampling you will need to
limit the sample rate of some effects in order to be able to use some
presets. Of course that reduce the sound quality, but sure you can find a good
balance settings. You can select the libsample rate quality for the Up/Down
process.</p>

<p><b>Whaveshape Resampling</b></p>
<p> Distortion, Overdrive, Derelict, MBDist and StompBox effects use the
waveshape internal class to saturate the signal, this kind of process
produce sound aliasing, here you can resample in order to eliminate this
aliasing, of course that will cost CPU. Notice that this resample is multipied
but the normal resampling.</p>

<p><b>Tuner Calibration A440</b></p>
<p> Here you can calibrate the Tuner, this also calibrates the MIDI
Converter, Ring and Harmonizer recognize note functions.</p>

<h2>MIDI Preferences</h2>
<p><img alt="Settings MIDI" src="imagenes/settings2.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Auto Connect ALSA Sequencer Ports</b></p>
<p>Here you can select if you want to auto connect the
rakarrack MIDI IN to another device when the program starts, and you
can select the device, also when the program is running you can
connect here o use other utilities to do that.</p>

<p><b>Midi Channels</b></p>
<p>You can specify the MIDI Receive Channel for rakarrack
also there are a special channel to receive the MIDI Chords for the
Harmonizer.</p>

<p><b>Midi Implementation</b></p>
<p>The MIDI Implementation radio buttons selects how
rakarrack interpret the incoming MIDI Control messages, by default we
use our MIDI implementation table, but you can also use MIDI learn to
create your own tables.</p>

<p>Here you can select if you want to auto connect the
Jack ports Input and Output, you can select any of the available ports for each type of port.</p>
<p>If you select a single Input port, will be connected to the both rakarrack Input Ports.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: The number of
selected Output ports needs to be an odd number, also the number of
selected Input ports need to be a odd number if it's greater than 1.</p>

<p><b>Author</b></p>
<p>Here you can define a nickname that was recorded in
the presets that are created. The development team intends to create
banks of effects created by users. These presets should assume the
same license with which this program is released (GPL version 2 or
higher) and suggest carrying an identification in the form First Name
Last Name (nick). Of course you have to give a descriptive name to
your preset. If you have a good preset and want to share or want to
be included in future versions, send it to this address
