<h2>MIDI Learn</h2>

<h2><img alt="MIDI Learn window" src="imagenes/midilearn.jpg"></h2>

<p>In order to access the MIDI learn window you must first check the
box for "MIDI Learn" in <a href="general.html#midi">Settings/Preferences/MIDI</a>
of the <a href="general.html#midi-imp">MIDI Implementation</a> section.</p>

<p>The MIDI Learn window allows you to create a MIDI implementation
table for each preset in a bank. There are two browsers,
one at the left with all the available effect parameters,
and another at the right with all the presets in the Bank.</p>

<p> You can open this window clicking the right mouse over an effect
parameter that can be controllable by MIDI. Also you can auto assign the
incoming MIDI Control message "automatically" if you enable in
<a href="general.html#midi">Settings/Preferences/MIDI</a> -
<a href="general.html#midi-auto">Auto Assign MIDI Learn</a>.</p>

<p>The radio buttons "All" and "Current" select the parameters listed in the
browser. "Current" displays only the actual preset parameters available in
MIDI learn.</p>

<p>The most important thing here is the input box located below the
parameter browser. The MIDI control message can be edited by selecting and dragging,
or capturing an incoming MIDI message by clicking on the Get MIDI Message button.
When the desired control number is selected, it must be assigned to the effect by clicking
on the assign button. The MIDI control will then be assigned to the selected
effect parameter on the browser.</p>

<p>You can "Assign" up to 20 effects parameters for a single
control number message. Also you can use different control
messages to manage only one effect parameter.</p>
<p>The "Assign to All" <b>adds</b> this
single assignment to all the presets in the bank, preserving
everything that you have previously assigned in all the presets.
The "Copy to All" button that overwrites all the assignments.</p>


<p>The grid boxes in the middle display the engaged MIDI
control messages to the selected effect parameter on the browser, the
Assignment for a single effect parameter can be cleared with the
button "Clear Assignments", also you can clear all the assignments
for this preset with the button Clear Preset".</p>

<p>In the left part of the window you have the list of presets in the
working bank, you can copy from or to the selected preset, that copy
all the preset table of a single preset.</p>
<p>The "Copy to All" button copy the actual preset to all the presets in the Bank.</p>


<p>The midi learn implementation tables is saved on the preset file
for a single preset, and in a separate file in the case of the Banks,
the program read this bank preset file when read the normal bank file.</p>
