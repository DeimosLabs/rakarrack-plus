<h2 class="western"><a name="desc"></a>GENERAL</h2>

<p>RAKARRACK is a multi-effect processor for guitar players but the
signal processing engine allows a full range of parameter adjustment
making it suitable for almost any audio processing task.
Thirty-two
effects are included in this version: Lineal EQ, Parametric EQ,
Shuffle, Exciter, Compressor,
Expander, Distortion, Overdrive, Derelict, DistBand, Echo,
MusicalDelay, Arpie, Chorus, Phaser, Analogic
Phaser, Flanger, Dual Flange, Reverb, WahWah, Alienwah,
MuTroMojo, Convolotron, Cabinet, Valve, AutoPan/Extra Stereo,
Harmonizer, Noise Gate, Ring, Synthfilter, VaryBand and Looper. Ten can
be used simultaneously on a
chain. Also has a Tuner and a monophonic MIDI Converter. Rakarrack
can be managed externally by MIDI, the program receive Program Change
and the parameters can be controlled via Control Change MIDI
messages.</p>

<p>One of the most important things of RAKARRACK is that everything
is on a single mouse click. All the effect parameters are on the
screen.</p>

<p>The effects are processed on a chain, the chain order processing
is fully configurable by the user for each preset. The preset saves
all the effects parameters. These presets can be grouped into banks
to manage more efficiently. Saving a preset is as easy as typing a
name </p>

<p>Rakarrack is capable of generating high volume output. It has Gain
controls in general and some of the effects allow high gain
adjustments. Use these gains with caution because they can produce
unwanted effects. However, a limiter is applied to the final output
which prevents signal level from increasing beyond 0dB. Bear this in
mind, for high gains triggering limiting in the output will initiate
high-ratio hard-knee compression. This is better than hard clipping
distortion, but the audio effect can be undesirable.</p>

<p align="left">Rakarrack is a JACK application, Dave Phillips wrote
some good articles in their blog of how to use linux audio with jack,
if you don't know about jack, or you have problems running rakarrack,
please read this series of articles:</p>

<h3>INSTALL</h3>

<p>Please read the INSTALL, README and PACKAGERS.README files provided
with rakarrack. You will find there a&nbsp; list of required dependency
packages and detailed configuration options.</p>



<h3>Warning</h3>


<p>From 0.5.0 version we have included resampling and convolotron
effect, the quality and amount settings of resampling must be set with
extremely care,&nbsp; because they use&nbsp; a&nbsp; lot of CPU
resources, in fact most computers can't afford the "Best" resampling
quality if the amount of resampling is "x4" or greater. The resampling
process makes each effect use more CPU resources because need to
process more samples, if you combine wrong settings with convolotron or
harmonizer effects that use also a lot CPU resources the results can be
unpredictable.&nbsp; Wrong settings can hang up you computer. You have
been warned. <br>
</p>

<p>Of course resampling increase the sound quality, the way to set up
is start with the worst resampling settings, amount = "x2"&nbsp; and
Quality "Linear", the the jack load cpu value is displayed in the
status bar in the preset block, if you want more accurate CPU usage
values use top, htop or
other CPU monitors, then increase the values thinking that then next
step of quality could use double CPU than the actual set, that's not
exactly in the lower resampling quality levels,&nbsp; but is more or
less accurate in the high levels. You need to find a good balance
between amount and quality settings to obtain the better sound that
your computer can afford. Don't forget that each effect use also more
CPU with resampling, then the best to set the resampling settings is
using a preset that has five or six effects.<br>
</p>

<p>Convolotron has a "Safe Mode" parameter, that "magically" limits the
length of the Impulse Response file readed, this is safe because limit
the CPU usage, this maximum length is calculated reading the bogomips,
is not dynamic and don't meassure other tasks that your computer may be
performing. We have been careful to calculate this maximum value, but
if you use resampling this "safe" value can be ridiculous and may cause
depending of the Impulse Response file readed that the convolotron
effect don't has sound, that can happens if the value is less than 5 ms.</p>

<p>Of course increasing the length parameter you will obtain a better
convolotron sound, if you unset the "Safe Mode" you can set the length
to a desired value without the magical limit, but do that with
extremely care. Check the jack load CPU in the status bar or use a CPU monitor to see what
your computer can afford. Do that with small steps and checking the CPU
usage, or you will hang up your computer. You have been warned.<br>

</p>

<h3 class="western">Connecting</h3>

<p>The connections shown in the screenshot correspond to a
motherboard sound card. The guitar is connected to the input line.
Obviously this configuration can vary depending of your sound card.
RAKARRACK has two inputs to allow use of stereo devices. The
screenshot shows the connection of a guitar, usually mono aural.</p>

</p>

<h3 class="western">Presets &amp; Banks</h3>

<p align="justify">The state of the rack can be saved to a file at any
time, either pressing the "Save" buttons or via the menu
File-&gt;Save Preset. Rakarrack suggest the preset name for the
filename.rkr in the save operation, but you can put what you want.
You can assign the preset name here:</p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000"><img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 571px; height: 140px;" src="imagenes/preset_name1.png" name="graphics4" alt="rakarrack Preset Box"></font></font>
</p>

<p>If the user modifies any preset bank, The "compare"
button allows you to compare the sound of the current state of
rakarrack with the original bank preset from which it departed.</p>

<p>You can use banks to store groups of presets. 80 preset can be
saved on a bank. To include a preset in a bank must first indicate
the name of preset on the main screen, open the bank window and click
on a empty slot with the right mouse button. To retrieve a preset
stored in a bank must open the window of banks and clicking the left
button on the preset desired, also you can use the Preset selector of
the main window.</p>

<p>To save a preset in a bank:</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Put descriptive name to the preset </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Open the bank window (B) </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Press the <b>right mouse button</b> in a empty place OR </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Press the <b>right mouse button</b> on an existing preset if
you wish to overwrite it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To retrieve a preset from a bank:</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Open the bank window (B) </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <b>left mouse button</b> on the preset </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When rakarrack starts always load the bank selected in <a href="#settings">preferences</a>
unless you specify another bank in the <a href="#cmd">command line</a>.
Of course you can load/save any bank via menu File. By default, is
allocated in preferences the installation included bank. This bank
("Default.rkrb") is installed with root properties, then
you can't overwrite as user. But is easy to save in any place to work
with it. The bank contains default presets developed by <a href="#autores">the
development team and some friends</a> who have contributed in this
facet.</p>
<p>Two banks are released with rakarrack, Default.rkrb and Extra.rkrb, they are
installed in the data directory selected in the configure process
normally in "/usr/share/rakarrack" or "/usr/local/share/rakarrack".</p>

</p>

<p align="justify">Up the Bank windows screenshot, the tittle bar show
the loaded bank. Click on preset or use preset counter in the Preset
section to change the preset.</p>

<p align="justify">Presets marked with (*) use the Select mode in the
Harmonizer effect, that means you need to play a monophonic melody in
the Key/Chord selected. The harmonizer recognizes what note you play
and creates a second voice in the Key/Chord selected.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Upsampling<br>
</b></p>

<p align="justify">Enable upsampling using libsamplerate process the
effects with higher samplerate then the sound quality is imporved, all
the resample parameters will take effect the next time you launch
rakarrack.&nbsp; Enabling upsampling rakarrack will use a lot more CPU
resources of your computer, then take care to adjust all the upsampling
settings, you can hang your computer if your main processor can not
handle the resampling parameters. Each level of libsamplerate quality
use more nd more resources, and of course each effect use more CPU
resources because need to process a higher amount of data. I higly
recommend start with Linear quality and amount "x2" and check your CPU
usage with "top", and then increase the amount/quality as desired.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>#<br>
</b></p>

<p align="justify">Amount of resampling (x2, x3, x4, x5, x6)</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Up.Q.</b><br>
</p>

<p align="justify">Upsampling quality, select the libsamplerate quality
for the upsampling
procedure.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Down Q.</b></p>

<p align="justify">Downsampling quality, select the
libsamplerate quality for the downsampling procedure.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Harmonizer Quality</b></p>

<p align="justify">Selects the quality of the harmonizer audio
engine, used by Harmonizer, Shifter and Sequence effects, the available
values are "4,8,16,32", the default value is "4". Incrementing the quality
increments the CPU usage by this effect. Take specially care if you are
using resampling too.
This parameter will take effect the next time you run rakarrack.</p>

<p align="justify"><u><b>MIDI</b></u></p>

<p align="justify">Here you can select if you want to auto connect the
rakarrack MIDI IN to another device when the program starts, and you
can select the device, also when the program is running you can
connect here o use other utilities to do that.<br>
</p>

<p align="justify">The MIDI Implementation radio buttons selects how
rakarrack interpret the incoming MIDI Control mesages, by default we
use our MIDI implementation table, but you can also use MIDI learn to
create your own tables.<br>
</p>

<p align="justify"><u><b>Jack</b></u></p>

<p align="justify">Here you can select if you want to auto connect the
Jack ports Input and Output, you can select any of the available ports for each type of port. <br>
</p>
<p align="justify">If you select a single Input port, will be connected to the both rakarrack Input Ports.</p>
<p align="justify">IMPORTANT: The number of
selected Output ports needs to be an odd number, also the number of
selected Input ports need to be a odd number if it's greater than 1.<br>
 </p>


<p align="justify"><u><b>Misc</b></u></p>

<p align="justify">Here you can define a nickname that was recorded in
the presets that are created. The development team intends to create
banks of effects created by users. These presets should assume the
same license with which this program is released (GPL version 2 or
higher) and suggest carrying an identification in the form First Name
Last Name (nick). Of course you have to give a descriptive name to
your preset. If you have a good preset and want to share or want to
be included in future versions, send it to this address
<a href="mailto:holborn@users.sourceforge.net">holborn@users.sourceforge.net</a></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Tap Tempo Timeout</b></p>


<p align="justify">Enable/Disable
the Tap Tempo timeout, if it's enabled,&nbsp; 8 seconds&nbsp; after the
last signal, Tap Tempo is put to Off</p>

<p align="justify"><u><b>Bank</b></u></p>


<p align="justify">Here you can specify what file bank is loaded when
program starts.</p>

<p>This is the MIDI Learn window, that brings the posibility to create
a MIDI implementation table for each preset in the bank. You can see
two browsers, one at the left with all the available effect&nbsp;
parameters,
and another at the right with all the presets in the Bank.<br>
</p>

<p>The most important thing here is the input box located below the
parameter browser, here you can select the number of the MIDI Control
Message, you can edit by hand, or selecting and draging, or capturing
an incoming MIDI message clicking on the Get MIDI Message button. When
you have the desired control number you need to assign to the effect
parameters, clicking on the button assing, this message will be engaged
to the selected effect parameter on the browser.<br>
</p>

<p>You can "Assign" up to 20 effects parameter&nbsp; for a single
control number message, also you can use different&nbsp; control
messages to&nbsp; manage&nbsp; only one effect parameter.</p>
<p>The "Assing to All" <b>add</b> this
single assignement to all the presets in the bank, preserving
everything that you have previously assigned in all the presets,
contrary to what is doing in the "Copy to All" button that overwirte
all the assignements.<br>
</p>


<p>The grid boxes in the middle display the engaged MIDI
control messages to the selected effect parameter on the browser, the
Assignement for a single effect parameter can be cleared with the
button "Clear Assignements", also you can clear all the assignements
for this preset with the button Clear Preset".<br>
</p>

<p>In the left part of the window you have the list of presets in the
working bank, you can copy from or to the selected preset, that copy
all the preset table of a single preset.</p>
<p>The "Copy to All" button copy the actual preset to all the presets in the Bank.<br>
</p>


<p>The midi learn implementatition tables is saved on the preset file
for a single preset, and in a separate file in the case of the Banks,
the program read this bank preset file when read the normal bank file. <br>

      <p>Originally adapted from ArtsCompressor. DSP routine has been
rewritten entirely as the code had been adapted at a stage in
ArtsCompressor development prior to many bug fixes that occurred later
in its evolution which unfortunately removed calculation of a
soft-knee compression characteristic. This is mentioned to give hope to
those who were aware of the bugs in compressor in Rakarrack 0.3.0.
These bugs have been fixed, and this compressor has been traced using
test signals to confirm it does what we think it does. </p>
      <p><b>A. Time</b>: Attack Time. Time in milliseconds for attack to
settle to 64% of final amount of compression.</p>
      <p><b>R. Time</b>: Release Time. Time in milliseconds for gain to return
to 64% of it's initial setting.</p>
      <p>Note: For the curious, the strange number, 64%, relates to the
RC time constant (RC means Resistor-Capacitor), which follows a natural
exponential curve. The use of this behavior will make this compressor
feel more natural to one who is most familiar with rack-mounted analog
compressors.</p>
      <p><b>Ratio</b>: For every Ratio (dB) that the input exceeds the
Threshold, the output will be allowed to increase by 1 dB. For example,
using compression ratio of 2, if the signal gets 2dB above the
threshold, the output will only go 1dB above the threshold.</p>
      <p><b>Knee</b>: Percentage of the region in dB of space between
Threshold and 0dB (basically is Knee X -Threshold). Within this region,
the ratio increases from 1 to log2(ratio). Threshold + Knee marks the
point of full compression onset. For example, if knee is set to 100%, a
very gradual compression characteristic will be obtained, but the
maximum compression available is log2(ratio). A ratio of 32 will result
in a real ratio ranging from 1 to 5. This is useful for processing
cymbals as it does not crunch the dynamic attack quite so badly, but
helps sustain the trailing resonance.</p>
      <p><b>Thrhold</b>: Threshold. Defines the onset of compression. </p>
      <p><b>Output</b>: How much gain to remove from the final stage of the
compressor.</p>
      <p><b>Auto Output</b>: Automatically calculate makeup gain. If this is
unchecked, then adjustments of Ratio, Knee, and Thrhold will make
changes to the overall output level. Unchecking may be useful to
interpret Thrhold as a limiting threshold, and one would likely use a
high ratio in this case.</p>

      <p>Adapted from the ZynAddSubFX 'Distorsion'</p>
      <p>This is a waveshaper, and not particularly an amp or stompbox
modeling effect. This must be used judiciously with EQ's as well as the
LPF and HPF settings (Low Pass Filter, High Pass Filter).</p>
      <p>Tip: Your classic green stompbox has a Pre Filter curve with
cutoff at 720Hz. This corresponds to approximately 51 on the HPF
setting. If trying to emulate stompbox or amp sounds, it is highly
advisable to use the Pre Filter option with HPF higher than 30 and LPF
lower than 70. As you increase drive, decrease LPF. </p>
      <p>Rakarrack attempts to be friendly to computers limited in both
RAM and CPU. Because of this, the waveshaper does not use oversampling
to reduce the effects of digital aliasing. Without going deep into DSP
theory, this means that hard clipping with a lot of drive will create
harmonics that are greater than half the sampling rate. These harmonics
get mirrored back into the audio range. If they are significant in
magnitude, then there will be a "grainy" non-musical sound. This is
what most guitarists are talking about when making reference to
"digital distortion". Functions like Sine, Pow and Atan generate a lot
of harmonics, and even at lower signal levels. Lmt, Clip and Zigzag are
among the worst, but these are generally used for nasty noisey sounds,
so a little digital aliasing may not be a bad thing.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, for instruments such as guitars, you can
significantly limit the bandwidth of the input signal without
catastrophically discoloring the timbre of the instrument by applying
Low Pass Pre-filtering. By reducing the high frequency content of the
input, you can greatly minimize the level of aliasing harmonics present
in the output. </p>
      <p>The main point is that great sounding distortions can be
obtained from Rakarrack, but the distortion module is not meant to
emulate your favorite stompbox, but to off the flexibility create these
sounds as well as unique flavors of distortion.</p>
      <p>The Crunch waveshaping type is the most physically informed of
the waveshaping functions currently used. The clipping characteristic
is most closely related to curve produced by a JFET amplifier stage.
With proper EQ settings, a sound reminiscent of high gain British
stacks can be obtained.</p>
      <p><b>Sub Octv</b>: Allows you to mix some sub-octave rumble into the
output. Technically speaking, this modulates the output with a square
wave at half the fundamental frequency (sub octave). </p>

      <p><b>Reverse</b>: Mixes reverse delay with forward delay.</p>
      <p>More about reverse: Echo works by storing audio samples in
memory and playing back samples that were stored a while ago. At a
sample rate of 48kHz, the number of samples stored in memory for a 1
second delay is 48,000. To play back audio from 1 second ago, there is
a reader that increments through, right in front of the write. The
reader reads a sample from a second ago, and the writer writes that
memory location with a new sample from the present.</p>
      <p>Now, what if we could read this block of memory backwards?
Then everything stored in memory comes out in reverse, and has an
interesting reverse envelop sound. In the digital word, we can read it
forward as easily as backwards, so why not keep track of both and let
you mix them together?</p>
      <p><b>Pan</b>: Sends the delay more to the right or left. Zero balances
it in the middle.</p>
      <p><b>Delay</b>: Amount of time before you hear the echo.</p>
      <p><b>Lrdl.</b>: Left/Right delay difference. A setting of 64 means
that the delay time is the same for left and right channels. If larger
than 64, the right channel is delayed longer than the left channel.
Less than 64 the reverse is true. This allows you to achieve the stereo

      <p>ZynAddSubFX Phaser Seriously Hacked</p>
      <p>Overhauled DSP engine in Zyn phaser and used shell to create a
"Physically Informed Digital Model of an Analog FET Phaser". Don't
forget to spit after chewing that mouthful.</p>
      <p>When should you want to use Phaser instead?</p>
      <p>A) Next to the pitch shifter, Analog Phaser is one of the most
CPU intensive FX in Rakarrack. If you find your computer can't handle
it, then Phaser is much more friendly to slow processors.</p>
      <p>B) You just plain like the original Phaser Effect and want to
use it.</p>
      <p>C) When you want to use two phasers at the same time, you can
chain Analog Phaser and Phaser together for some unique filtering
sounds.</p>
      <p>A Phaser works by adding a delay to a certain group of
frequencies and shifting the filter that selects the group of
frequencies up and down the spectrum. When mixed with the original
input, some of the delayed parts of the signal cancel with the the
original (destructive interference). The technical term for this is
'notch filter'. For every two phase stages, a new notch appears in the
spectrum, so for 4 stages and up we have a 'comb filter' because a plot
of the frequency response begins to look like something you use to
brush your hair as the number of phase stages increases.</p>
      <p>If you don't care about what's under the hood, skip this
paragraph -- To get the basic behavior of an Analog Phaser, the
transfer function of a real analog phaser all-pass filter stage was
computed and transformed into a discrete-time equivalent transfer
function, then broken down into the resulting numerical computation
algorithm. These all-pass filter stages were chained together in
sequence of the overall analog circuit. Five or six different
schematics were referenced in the design of this model to see what
different units do to achieve a certain sound. The resulting 'Virtual
Circuit' is an original creation. Finally, some of the non-perfect
physical components and distortion were modeled in a simplistic way to
add a certain warmth to the effect without sinking your CPU into an ice
age.</p>
      <p><b>Wet/Dry</b>: At zero, both the phase shifted signal and input
signal are mixed equally. This creates the deepest notch filter. Why
would you want to mix all Wet? Modulating the all-pass filter stages
can create frequency shifting at faster modulation rates. This produces
a chorus-like effect, and you may want the frequency bending without
the notch filtering. Think UniVibe.</p>
      <p><b>LFO Type</b>: More or less self explanatory. The Barber Pole
setting will disappoint you if you're looking for a true barber pole
phaser. This is simply an arrangement of multiple ramps modulating the
phaser, so you hear the thump every time the ramp starts over. It's a
pleasant enough effect at really slow rates, and creates something
interesting at very high rates. In between it's annoying :) .</p>
      <p><b>Tempo</b>: LFO frequency.</p>
      <p><b>Depth</b>: How deep the phaser can sweep. It's an LFO offset. 64
is dead center. If you want it to stay in the high range, set this
higher than 64. If you want the phaser to spend more time carving out
the lower frequency range, set this to some thing less than 64.</p>
      <p><b>Width</b>: This is how far the LFO travels. It's the LFO amplitude.</p>
      <p><b>Fb</b>: Feedback. Usually named 'Regen' on a phaser stompbox. For
deeper notches keep Fb negative for even number stages and positive for
odd number stages.</p>
      <p><b>Mismatch</b>: FET Phasers suffer from the manufacturing process of
JFET transistors. These things generally vary over a very wide range of
properties per batch. What does this mean to a Phaser? It means that
the frequency where 45 degrees phase shift occurs varies from stage to
stage. This mismatch makes the notches wider, but less deep. This
parameter best aligns with reality at a setting of 5 to 10. Large
settings may be used to obtain a better 'Vibe sound.</p>
      <p><b>Distort</b>: FETs used as variable resistors are only linear over
a certain range. This nonlinearity adds harmonics to the processed
signal and somewhat warps the frequency response. This is a very subtle
effect, but worthwhile to be able to zero it if you don't want it
modeled.</p>
      <p><b>St. Diff</b>: Stereo Difference. Delay the LFO in the right or
left channel. This combined with the panner effect can make it sound
like something is twirling in an elliptical orbit around your head.</p>
      <p><b>Stages</b>: First order all-pass filter networks to be chained
together. Set to one for a high pass filter (or low pass filter with
subtract checked). 4 stages is very typical in the average stompbox.
Bi-mode and Tri-mode phasers include switchable 6 and 8 stage filters.
It's rare to see an analog phaser with more than 8 stages in stompbox
form because parts get expensive, and noise becomes an expensive design
problem to mitigate. In the digital world, adding more stages is just
another time through the filter loop if you can spare the CPU time.</p>
      <p><b>Subtract</b>: Subtract wet from dry instead of add.</p>
      <p><b>Hyper</b>: Flattens out the lower end of the LFO. Used with a Tri
wave, this emulates the "Hyper Sine" found in some analog phaser
pedals. It was a clever way that analog filter designers contrived to
make the LFO behave according to the human's perception of frequency.
To our ears, musical pitch increases exponentially with frequency.</p>

      <p align="justify">Rakarrack harmonizer effect use the audio
engine of the smbPtichShifter.cpp located at
http://www.dspdimension.com. In order to save CPU use only a mono
pitch-shifter in the lowest quality available, you can change this on
the program <a href="#settings">Settings</a> window, but only for a
low quality values because high quality ones use too much CPU. The
audio signal converted to mono is send it to the pitch-shifter and
returned to the two pole Peak filter, panned and send it to both
channels L/R. The rakarrack Harmonizer has 3 modes:</p>
      <h4 class="western">Normal Mode</h4>
      <p align="justify">Is how a normal pitchshifter run, the pitch
ratio is fixed and can be selected in the <b>Interval</b> effect
parameter of the effect.</p>
      <h4 class="western">Select Mode</h4>
      <p align="justify">In this mode the pitch ratio is variable, this
value depends of the selected <b>Interval</b> parameter, and the <b>Note</b>
and <b>Chord</b> effect parameters. Rakarrack then recognize the audio
note played (Only "melodies" monophonic data can be played in this
mode) and modifies the pitch ratio in order to do a musical
harmonization with the Tonality/Chord selected in the parameters, of
course the twelve tonality's are available and 33 chords:</p>

      <h4 class="western">MIDI Mode</h4>
      <p align="justify">This mode run in the same way as <b>Select
Mode</b> but the Tonality/Chord is recognized via MIDI notes, the MIDI
chord recognizer recognizes all the above chords plus all the
inversions and bass changed chords, also has memory, they use the chord
just another chord is send it and recognized. The MIDI channel can be
selected in the <a href="#settings">Settings</a> window, then the
Harmonizer adjust the pitch ratio with the audio note recognized,
played by the user, and the Tonality/Chord received via MIDI.

to plucking by sweeping upward in frequency. When this is set higher
than 64, then the filter responds to plucking by sweeping downward in

Basic operation of a flanger:&nbsp; Delay the incoming signal and add
it to the input signal.&nbsp; This creates destructive interference in
a similar manner to a Phaser, but the notch filter frequencies are
evenly spaced from the lowest notch up to infinity (in theory).<br>
      <br>
Dual Flange picks two different delays and adds them to the input
signal.&nbsp; The two separately delayed paths have a spacing re<br>
lationship that follows the other by a percentage, and not a constant
offset.&nbsp; At maximum wet, these two delay "taps" are added equally,
thus the notches between the two are infinitely deep, and the effect is
at its maximum severity.&nbsp; Mixing in the clean signal reduces the
depth of the notches, but also creates a complex and interesting
frequency response.&nbsp; The result is a unique color to the tone not
available by a standard flanger.<br>

      <p align="justify">The
primary purpose for this effect is to offer a differently natured Noise
Gate than the "Noise Gate" module.&nbsp; The turn-on characteristic is
modeled after that of a BJT transistor, thus it behaves more similarly
to an analog noise gate.&nbsp; It is likely that Expander uses less CPU
resources than Noise Gate, but neither are very resource intensive
modules.<br>
The basic behavior is the louder you play, the louder it gets until it
gets pinned at the maximum "Level".&nbsp; As a noise gate, the volume
is exponentially increased in the lower volume levels until Threshold,
at which point the gate is entirely open.<br>
To use the effect as an expander, it is best to set the threshold at
higher levels, and shape at moderate levels (less than 10). Short
attack/release times in this mode will cause it to work much like one
would expect from a dynamics expander.&nbsp; In this mode it is
essentially a compressor in reverse.<br>
To take the idea of expander a little further, one can set long attack
times and short release times to achieve a string swell effect akin to
adjusting the volume pot on the guitar...only the effect does it
automatically for you.<br>
Finally, the filters may be used for a bit of frequency shaping before
a distortion effect, or used in front of the Compressor to help brighten<br>
the tone.</p>

      <p><b>A. Time</b>: Attack Time, time to open the gate</p>
      <p><b>R. Time</b>: Release Time, time it takes the gate to return to off
      state</p>
      <p><b>Shape</b>: Gate transition
shape.&nbsp; Large number means gate turns on suddenly at
threshold.&nbsp; Small number means gate gradually turns on Noise
suppression is best at higher numbers, but the gradual expansion above
the threshold can be a more musical way for gate&nbsp; to turn on.</p>
      <p><b>Thrhold</b>: Threshold.&nbsp;
The gate is reducing signal volume below this level.&nbsp; Moderate
threshold setting with smaller number for shape is useful for string
swell effects.</p>

      <p align="justify">A different type of view of
the Analog Phaser effect revealed a basic structure supporting
high-order filters with adjustable number of filter stages ...most of
the
work was already done, so thanks again to Paul Nasca for this piece of
code from the original ZynAddSubFX Phaser.&nbsp; <br>
Starting with a phaser
(as opposed to wah-wah or EQ) was inspired by a phaser circuit
modification suggested by Mark Hammer, a frequent forum poster at
diystompboxes.com/smfforum.&nbsp; This modification allowed two phase
stages to be converted to low-pass stages with a switch in an analog
phaser.&nbsp; This is the type of effect marketed as a
"phase-wah".&nbsp; Of course, converting all of these phase stages to
low pass stages makes this circuit look an aweful lot like what is
found inside the old Korg Delta DL-50 synthesizer.&nbsp; <br>
Converting a
normal OTA phaser into a synth filter would be a relatively ugly hack
in the circuit bending world, but a simple excercise in software
bending, and with a more elegant final product. With a little bit of
experimentation, I had a filter sounding much like something found in
an analog synthesizer.&nbsp; Thinking back to an analog envelope filter
I once built, I determined high pass filter stages would also be of
great utility.&nbsp; The final result:&nbsp; A very flexible filter
module able to accomplish many flavors of low pass, band pass and high
pass filter shapes.&nbsp; Possibilities range anywhere from simple
wah-wah sounds to definite mushy filters from synthland.&nbsp; You can
operate up to 12 high-pass and 12 low pass stages simultaneously. At
present, the user is protected from resonance near instability.&nbsp;
If you are a synth filter lover and want to be able to make your filter
unstable, then it is a very minor adjustment to the source code if you
wish to internally amp up the feedback range to allow this. Finally,
the SynthFilter comes with wet/dry mix so you can accomplish
interesting phase-wah sounds.</p>

      <p align="justify">Convolotron A module optimized for physical
speaker/cabinet modeling.</p>
      <p align="justify">A lame EE joke: "If you do that once, I will
convolve your face
with a Dirac Delta. If you do it again, I will convolve your head with
an impulse train."</p>
      <p align="justify">Some jargon associated with this effect:</p>
      <p align="justify"><b>IR&nbsp; Impulse Response</b>.&nbsp;
Filters are often classified according to their impulse response. An
impulse response is the output of the filter (or physical system)
resulting from application of a short-duration, one-time, "impulse" of
energy. An audio signal can be constructed mathematically as
a series of such impulses separated by an infinitesimal period of time,
and scaled by a certain factor representing the real-time amplitude of
the signal.&nbsp; If one impulse is applied to a filter, the filter
begins to react with its characteristic impulse response. Then if
another impulse is applied a little later, the same impulse response is
invoked and is added to the first.&nbsp; If we think of the audio&nbsp;
signal as a rapid succession of impulses, then the result of adding up
all the impulse responses will reconstruct what the physical system
will do in response to the input signal. This process is called
convolution.</p>
      <p align="justify"><b>Convolution</b>.&nbsp;
A process of successively adding the impulse responses for any signal
that has been or will be applied to the system.&nbsp; In the case of
realtime audio processing the impulse responses are causal in nature,
so we can
ignore the future and apply the effects only for what has already
occured.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Convolotron</b>.&nbsp; A
rakarrack module that takes an audio file as an IR, and convolves it
with the input signal.&nbsp; This signal may be an IR recorded from an
amplifier, a microphone,&nbsp; a cheap computer speaker system, horns,
bells, gongs, reverb...kicking a door...<br>
      </p>
      <p>Some caveats:&nbsp; Convolotron is very CPU hungry.&nbsp;
Rakarrack
does straight-forward time-domain convolution.&nbsp; Another Linux
software application to compare is&nbsp; JConv, which is not as CPU
hungry because there are
some frequency domain math tricks which allow the user to sacrifice
some quality to reduce&nbsp; processing load.&nbsp; As a result, Rakarrack requires some
"horsepower", but is better suited to amplifier/cabinet modeling
assuming your CPU can handle it. <br>
      </p>
      <p> <b>Parameters</b></p>
      <p><b>Wet/Dry</b>:&nbsp; Self explanatory.&nbsp;
For amp responses, most of the time you will want this all wet.</p>
      <p><b>Pan</b>: The effect is processed in mono (L &amp; R are mixed
on the
input).&nbsp; Pan routes the output left or right.</p>
      <p><b>Level</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The actual IR file will determine
the gain of the effect.&nbsp; This helps you adjust&nbsp; to a good
level.</p>
      <p><b>Damp</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Darkens the sound of the IR.
      </p>
      <p><b>Fb</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feedback.&nbsp; Pretty
self explanatory.</p>
      <p><b>Length</b>: Measured in milliseconds. This tells Convolotron where to truncate the
IR. Set this to the maximum value your CPU can afford without
Xruns.&nbsp; A longer Length&nbsp; will result in a more true model of
the system being convolved.</p>
      
      <p><b></b><b>Safe Mode</b>: Automatically
limits Length internally based on sample rate and info from your&nbsp;
/proc/cpuinfo to help prevent freezing your computer.</p>
      <p><b>Preset</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp; Several amp IR's are available by
default for your convenience.</p>
      <p><b>User</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You may download or generate your own IR's.&nbsp; You can even do silly
things like loading ring tones or segments of a song (if you like to
experiment).&nbsp; Must be wav&nbsp; format, and keep in mind that
convolotron only uses the first&nbsp; "Length" milliseconds&nbsp; of
the file...so if you have a file with 100ms silence at the beginning,
you will get nothing but silence on the output.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

Higher is louder than the original signal, lower is more quiet.</p>
      <p><b>Level 2</b>: Volume level of track 2.</p>
      <p><b>Reverse</b>: Play loop in reverse.</p>
      <p><b>Auto Play</b>: If this is checked, the looper will begin to
play
automatically after recording the first time.</p>
      <p><b>Play</b>: This is more like enable/disable
playback.&nbsp; The loop keeps playing silently when disabled, so Play
starts at whatever point is current in the loop.&nbsp; It was decided
this is better than Play/Pause, because the loop keeps tracking with
your song (assuming you keep tempo) even when it's not audible.&nbsp;
This operates on the active track.&nbsp; If you desire a play/pause
function, use the FX "On" button.&nbsp; Selecting this to "off" causes
the whole effect to pause where it is.</p>
      <p><b>Stop</b>: Stops playback and sets the start to
the beginning of the loop.&nbsp; Use stop if you want to start the loop
from the beginning next time you push play.&nbsp; This operates on the
active track.</p>
      <p><b>Record</b>: First time, begins recording and
will continue to record until you push record again.&nbsp; At this
point you have defined the length of the loop.&nbsp; If you press
record again, everything you play will be overdubbed onto the
track.&nbsp; To erase the track, you need to have the track active and
select "clear".&nbsp; This operates on the active track only if R1 or
R2 (corresponding to the track) is selected.&nbsp; This allows you to
record on track 2 while hearing track 1.</p>
      <p><b>R1, R2</b>: Enable recording on track 1
and track 2, respectively.&nbsp; If neither are checked, then the
record button will not do anything.</p>
      <p><b>Track 1, 2</b>: Enable Play, Stop, Record on the selected
track.&nbsp;
Again, both the track and the R button need to be selected to record on
the specified track.</p>
      <p><b>Clear</b>: Erase the selected track and set
length to zero.</p>
      <br>
<p>Example sequence of operation:<br>
Set Wet/Dry to 0, Level 1 to 64, Auto Play Active, Track 1 active, R1
active. Press record and begin to play into the loop. When finished,
press record again, and your loop will immediately start up from the
beginning.&nbsp; Play along, or press record again to add more parts to
the loop. Harmonizer with Octave down for bass simulator can be of

      <p align="justify">MutroMojo</p>
      <p align="justify">The name is derived from two well known
effects using the same filter topology:<br>
Mutron, Mojotron.<br>
For those not well accustomed to classic analog pedal effects, these
were envelope controlled filters built upon the
state-variable-filter.&nbsp; This filter structure has three "states"
which can be extracted: High pass, Low pass, Band pass.&nbsp; This is
easy to implement digitally, and is much more efficient for the
processor than to compute the three filter bands as separate filters.<br>
      <br>
MuTroMojo allows you to adjust the three bands at whatever levels you
want.&nbsp; This flexibility allows anything from various wahwah
effects to synth filter effects, and possibly even sounds of the
moogerfooger (though Synthfilter structure is better suited to
"moog-like" sounds).&nbsp; Like any good Rakarrack effect, it has an
LFO synchronized to Tempo.&nbsp; This means Tap Tempo will set the rate
of the LFO effect. <br>
      <br>
Additionally, you have the envelope follower applied with the Amp S
parameter, and smoothed by Smooth.&nbsp; Here's the breakdown:<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Wet/Dry</b>: It's obvious that this
mixes wet and
dry signals, but this interacts like a phaser or flanger.&nbsp; By
mixing some Dry into higher order filters (increase Stages) you can
create notches in the frequency response.&nbsp; With individualized
control over HP, BP, and LP filter bands, you can create some
interesting comb filter responses.&nbsp; This is more than simply
"amount of effect".</p>
      <p><b>LP, BP, HP</b>: Low Pass, Band Pass, High Pass,
respectively.&nbsp;
Greater than zero mixes the output in phase, less than zero mixes the
output out of phase.&nbsp; This can be alternated to create different
types of destructive interference between filter bands.&nbsp; For the
more technically minded, you can dust off your filter cookbook and tune
in to a wide variety of filter responses.&nbsp; This can also be used
as a sort of parametric EQ or tone stack.</p>
      <p><b>Stg</b>: Stages. Each filter stage is a second
order
filter.&nbsp; "Stg" sets the number of filters in series.&nbsp; The
number of stages will improve the amount of rejection above/below the
cutoff.&nbsp; A tip:&nbsp; You can use this module as a compromise for
up sampling quality when using up sampling.&nbsp; For example set Wah
and Range to maximum levels with LP at 32 and BP, HP at 0.&nbsp; With
this configuration you have a 12dB/Octave low pass filter set at about
6kHz.&nbsp; For clean electric guitar, you won't lose much of the
original signal because most guitar pickups form such a filter at
5kHz.&nbsp; Then the upsampling can be set to Zero Order Hold, and this
filter will smooth it out.&nbsp; To improve quality, increase the
MuTroMojo Stages.&nbsp; In this mode it acts as an "Interpolating
Filter", which is able to reconstruct the missing information between
samples.&nbsp; The higher quality upsampling options do the same thing,
but they use much higher order Sinc interpolation filters and try to
maximize bandwidth.&nbsp; Unfortunately these higher order filters use
more CPU, and they also have bad transient responses. If you can
sacrifice the bandwidth, you can use lower order filters for nearly the
same result.&nbsp; This is where the MuTroMojo can give you more choice
with whether you want to trade bandwidth or CPU usage while balancing
transient characteristics.&nbsp; If none of that made sense, then maybe
you can ask on the rakarrack IRC channel for a better explanation...or
look up sample rate conversion and interpolation for discussion of the
trade-offs and benefits.&nbsp; Otherwise, just experiment with settings
that sound good to you, and forget about the technical details of why.</p>
      <p>
      <b>Width</b>: Deviation of the LFO.&nbsp; This
describes how
far it sweeps.</p>
      <p>
      <b>Tempo</b>: LFO Rate expressed in beats per minute.
This is
synchronized when Tap Tempo is active.</p>
      <p>
      <b>Res.</b>: Resonance.&nbsp; Increasing this
makes a higher
and more narrow peak at the filter resonant frequency.</p>
      <p>
      <b>Range</b>: Upper bound on the filter sweep range.</p>
      <p>
      <b>Wah</b>: Sweeps the filter resonant
frequency from
the minimum bound (hard coded in each preset) up to the upper bound
(set by Range).&nbsp; This is the parameter you would want to map to a
MIDI expression pedal for a wah wah effect.</p>

      <p align="justify">Vocoder</p>
      <p align="justify">For those not already familiar with vocoders, this is the effect responsible formany robot sounds on several popular songs.<br>
      <br>
The basic structure is this:<br>
Your voice from a microphone needs to be connected to the "Aux" input
of Rakarrack.&nbsp; Second, you will have some sound source coming
through Rakarrack's normal processing chain.&nbsp; This is likely a
guitar or synthesizer.&nbsp; When you speak into the mic, you will hear
the sound of your instrument with a robot-like voice.&nbsp; The best
types of signals are constant and rich in frequency content.&nbsp; For
example, distorted guitar chords are a good "carrier" for the
Vocoder.&nbsp; Various synthesizer strings sounds or brass emulations
are also good sources for the voice.<br>
      <br>
This particular implementation uses the analog Vocoder model.&nbsp;
These units were implemented with several parallel filter banks.&nbsp;
One filter bank was used on the voice, and the other on the
instrument.&nbsp; The bank on the voice was used to "find out" what
frequency bands are being used by the voice, then the power from each
of these bands was used to scale the corresponding bands on the
instrument so it has more or less power in these bands.&nbsp; Briefly
put, the power in the signal of each frequency band from the mic was
used to control the volume on each corresponding frequency band for the
incoming instrument.&nbsp; Think of two 32 band equalizers.&nbsp; The
first 32 band EQ has a mic plugged into it.&nbsp; As you speak into the
mic, you can se the VU meter bars bounce on each corresponding band (if
this is the kind of EQ that displays VU bars for every band).&nbsp;
Imagine something being linked to the VU meter bars that can push the
sliders up and down on the Equalizer used to process the
instrument.&nbsp; This is what a vocoder does.<br>
      <br>
Rakarrack uses a 32-band filter bank to implement the effect.&nbsp;
These are all second-order band pass filters spaced evenly on a
logarithmic scale from 300Hz to 3600Hz, thus covering most of the
important formant frequencies.<br>
      <br>
Additionally there are some basic hard-coded utilities to help in processing the voice channel:<br>
Gate:&nbsp; Anything below -75dB is gated.&nbsp; You can "cheat" the
gate with the Input level adjustment.&nbsp; If too much noise is
getting through to the vocoder when you're not talking, you can
decrease the input level until the noise floor disappears.&nbsp; Of
course, if you have a noisey preamp, mic, lots of background
noise...etc, this gives you poor signal/noise ratio, then there is
little we can program into the application to help improve the dynamics
:-(.&nbsp; <br>
Compressor:&nbsp; A simple compressor is applied to the vocals with a
ratio of approximately 2:1.&nbsp; It is implemented using
add/subtract/multiply/divide instructions to avoid CPU costly log and
pow functions.&nbsp; As a result, the compression curve looks more like
saturation on a vacuum tube or JFET, and the compression ratio
increases steadily with the input signal level.&nbsp; Consequently, it
is a soft-knee compressor and lends itself well to vocal processing as
a easy soft-knee compressor.&nbsp; Because of the way this compressor
behaves, increasing the Input level is tantamount to decreasing the
threshold and increasing ratio simultaneously.&nbsp; It is designed
this way so it works effectively without the user needing to know
anything about it.&nbsp; Incidentally, this same compressor is used to
create the Sustainer effect.<br>
      <br>
The take-home message with regard to the "invisible" utilities is that
the Input level parameter gives you a lot of power over the dynamics of
the microphone input, and can help in getting a good consistent vocal
sound onto the instrument being processed.<br>
      <br>
Here is the list of parameters:<br>
      <br>
<b>Wet/Dry</b>: We have been over this many times.<br>
<b>Pan</b>: Move the processed signal to the left or right<br>
<b>Input</b>: Microphone input level.&nbsp; Explained in detail above.<br>
<b>Muf.</b>: "Muffle".&nbsp; Maybe more like "blur" or
"smear".&nbsp; This increases the averaging time on the power coming
into each frequency band.&nbsp; Adjusting to a large level has an
effect of making it sound like the voice is in a very large reverberant
room.&nbsp; Lower levels achieve a more articulate sound.<br>
<b>Q</b>: Resonance of the
filters.&nbsp; Increasing this number makes the filter bands more
narrow.&nbsp; Extremely high values make the filters so resonant it
sounds like metallic reverberation.&nbsp; This also "smears" the
vocals.&nbsp; Unless you are going for extreme sounds, the best range
is 65 to 90.<br>
<b>Ring</b>: If you are going for extreme sounds, this
is the ticket.&nbsp; This causes the voice from each mic band to be
multiplied with each instrument band.&nbsp; The adjustment is basically
modulation depth.<br>
<b>Level</b>: Final output level.&nbsp; <br>

      <p align="justify">8-step sequencer with multiple modes of
operation.&nbsp; The sequencer controls effects that are hard-coded
internally which can be activated by the Mode selector.&nbsp; To date
the sequencer includes various modes for modulating a band-pass filter,
amplitude, and there is also a pitch bending mode based on the code
used in Harmonizer and Shifter.<br>
      <br>
Some of the uses include a sequenced tremolo (try Tremor mode) or
something akin to the Sample/Hold filter (Stepper mode), or a sequenced
wah wah (lineal).<br>
      <br>
<b>Preset</b>: Several built-in preset configurations exist to showcase the possibilities of the effect.<br>
      <br>
<b>Wet/Dry</b>: Nothing special here.<br>
      <br>
<b>Sliders 1 - 8</b>: Level of effect at each step in
the sequence.&nbsp; If a filter, sliders set filter center
frequency.&nbsp; If Tremor, sets volume of signal at the corresponding
step in the sequence.<br>
      <br>
<b>Tempo</b>: Rate in Beats Per Minute at which the sequencer changes to the next step.<br>
      <br>
<b>Q</b>: Filter resonance.&nbsp; This may or may not do anything
with modes that don't use a filter.&nbsp; For certain modes, it may be
used to control a "hidden" parameter, so it is worthwhile to try it to
see if it does something.<br>
      <br>
<b>St. df</b>: Stereo difference.&nbsp; This delays the right
channel sequence from the left by the number of steps selected
(1-8).&nbsp; This makes it sound as though the sound source is moving
all around the room.<br>
      <br>
<b>Range</b> For most modes, it provides a choice ranges over which the
sequence sliders control the parameter.&nbsp; For example, on a filter,
it controls the maximum and minimum center frequencies.<br>
      <br>
<b>Mode</b> Select different modes of operation.&nbsp; The modes include:<br>
<i>Lineal</i>: Filter &amp; optional amplitude. Moves smoothly from one step to the next.<br>
<i>Up Down</i>: Filter &amp; optional amplitude. Returns to zero between
steps, and steps up to the level adjusted in the sequence sliders.<br>
<i>Stepper</i>: Filter &amp; optional amplitude. Steps abruptly from
one level to the next.&nbsp; This is the most like a Sample/Hold
modulated filter.<br>
<i>Shifter</i>: Frequency shifter.&nbsp; Bends smoothly from one frequency
to the next<br>
<i>Tremor</i>: Amplitude.&nbsp; This is a sequenced Tremolo that can be
switched between two different stepping modes by the "Amp" switch.<br>
<i>Arpegiator</i>: Frequency shifter. Pass directly from one frequency to
      the next one, the semitone is adjusted by the sequence sliders,
      semitone = "slider value / 10".<br>
<i>Chorus</i>: Frequency Shifter, this mode use small amount of pitch
      shifter in order to generate a chorus effect.<br>
<b>Amp</b>: Invoke amplitude modulation when available in the mode. In
      Frequency shifter modes Amp is used to switch down the frequency.<br>
      <br> 
Finally, here is a reward for those who read the Help:<br>
What is a sequencer effect without a random mode?&nbsp; There is an
"Easter Egg" hidden in this effect that invokes a random
sequence.&nbsp; Pull all the step sliders (1-8) to zero.&nbsp; If the
sum of the values on these sliders is less than 4, then the Sequencer
will step randomly.&nbsp; To return to a sequenced operation, bring one
of the sliders to something greater than 4.&nbsp; At this point, the
Sequence queue contains the randomly generated levels from the last
complete cycle through the queue.&nbsp; In random mode, these are
refreshed on each cycle so the sequence does not repeat, but once you
leave random mode the current random sequence remains in the
queue.&nbsp; You can "erase" each of these one-by-one by adjusting the
corresponding slider.<br>

      <p align="justify">A stand-alone stompbox emulator.<br>
      <br>
Between the various equalization tools and distortion modules,
Rakarrack offers great flexibility to get a wide range of distortion
sounds, but this method requires much experimentation, while some
things are simply not possible.&nbsp; What if you are a person who
wants to dial in a good sound quickly, and don't enjoy tweaking
seemingly endless possibilities?<br>
      <br>
StompBox aims to simplify the process by giving the user a familiar
"StompBox" interface with only "Level", "Gain", and a 3-band EQ, which
generally covers all the features presented by a typical stompbox.<br>
      <br>
Additionally, most of these "Stomp Box" modes are physically informed
models of actual stompboxes, with the most notable features derived
from the circuit's schematic.&nbsp; Please enjoy these models as a
unique creation of their own, and not as something expected to be a
part-for-part replacement.&nbsp; It is my belief (as the developer)
that these models have some convincing characteristics, but I am aware
of many subtle things that are not taken into account.&nbsp; Further,
there are many variants of a specific type of pedal on the market; for
expample, an Overdrive pedal is basically the same circuit for almost
all models marketed as "overdrive".&nbsp; The differences are minor
variations that the specific designer determined produced a better
sound.&nbsp; Even though the names of the modes indicate one model or
the other, the internal signal processing in Rakarrack includes
variations of its own: some to counteract unfortunate digital artifacts
and some applied as common "mods" that tweakers apply to their physical
stompboxes.<br>
      <br>
Perhaps a good analogy would be that of an artistic painting versus a
photograph.&nbsp; The Rakarrack stompbox models are more like an
artistic painting, where the artist (programmer) looks at the object
(schematic), "paint" (write code) the prominent features, then add
details that make it become an identifiable image of the original
object.&nbsp; In contrast, a photograph captures things exactly how
they appear, with artifacts such as resolution and lighting/color
distortions.&nbsp; Many commercial products attempt more of a
"photographic" approach to stompbox modeling, where each part and
component is modeled in detail.&nbsp; This of course, makes the CPU
usage increase dramatically while IMHO little value is added in terms
of making a *GOOD* sound (however they do make it much more true to the
original).&nbsp; I think there would also be risk of legal issues if we
attempted to model commercial stompboxes exactly and (especially)
present them to our users in that form.&nbsp; For the most part you
will be able to tell what stompboxes were used as a standard for a
specific type of sound, as the names are relatively tell-tale.&nbsp;
Hopefully we have kept things generic enough to avoid aggravating the
industry.&nbsp; If any person of such authority takes issue, let it be
known we are happy to make changes &amp; remove things you feel are
infringing on your patent or trademark rights.&nbsp; However, being
free software, this is probably greater benefit in the form of free
marketing for these industries.<br>
      <br>
Last, not all of the stompboxes modeled actually have a 3-band
EQ.&nbsp; For these cases, one or two of the EQ bands is configured to
emulate the EQ control on the pedal while the others have a
configuration that matches the "theme" of the pedal, and they have no
effect at "0" setting.&nbsp; Thus, any pedal model will have EQ
controls that behave similarly to the original.<br>
      <br>
Now with all the explanation and disclaimers set aside, let's give some
insight to what this thing is able to do.&nbsp; The first important
parameter to understand is the "Mode" selector.&nbsp; This is where you
get to select the flavor of stompbox distortion you wish to model:<br>
      <br>
<b>Amp</b>: This is a model twice derived from a tube preamp.&nbsp;
The general circuit flow follows that of a typical overdrive pedal
(Tubescreamer type), however the waveshaper uses dynamically modulated
symmetry with a soft clipping function somewhat emulating the behavior
of a vacuum tube.&nbsp; The reason it is considered twice derived is
because the overdrive pedal originally used the frequency contouring of
a tube preamp along with a soft diode clipper to (poorly) emulate the
characteristics of an overdriven tube.&nbsp; Rakarrack "Amp" model
therefore is a model of a model, but the clipping routine is much more
dynamic and "alive" than the average diode clipper.&nbsp; The
pre-emphasis filter was modified somewhat to pick up more of the lower
end to make it better suited to fat blues lead tones.&nbsp; The 3-band
EQ is constructed based on criteria derived partially from a typical
tube amp tone stack blended with some of the character of the overdrive
pedal tone control.&nbsp; If Low and Mid bands are left flat (zero),
then the high band behaves like the OD pedal Tone control.<br>
      <br>
<b>Grunge</b>: This will explain itself to those who are familiar
with the source model.&nbsp; The original has only high and low EQ
bands.&nbsp; The Rakarrack model implements the mid band to allow for
some mid scooping, or a mid boost if desired.&nbsp; Set mid at "zero"
to get the most true behavior of the original.<br>
      <br>
<b>Rat</b><br>
<b>Fat Cat</b>: Rat and Fat Cat are minor variations on the same
thing.&nbsp; In truth, the difference between the two is subtle.&nbsp;
The EQ behaves like the original if low and mid bands are left flat
(zero).&nbsp; The high band behaves as the original tone control.&nbsp;
The mid band EQ is designed to work on frequencies associated with the
nasal sound.&nbsp; The low band is very broad and can be adjusted to
make the pedal sound very "beefy".<br>
      <br>
<b>Dist+</b>: The name says it all for any who know the
original.&nbsp; The original has no tone control, so all three bands
are fabricated.&nbsp; The EQ on this is of the same type as for the Rat
model.&nbsp; To get the sound of the original pedal, leave mid and low
flat, then push high to its maximum.<br>
      <br>
<b>Death</b>: A good mode for a raw-edged chainsaw guitar sound and death
metal enthusiasts.&nbsp; One may easily guess the original model if it
is stated that the internal circuit is identical to "Grunge", only some
contouring modifications and 3 bands of EQ.&nbsp; This model, unlike
the original, has a gain control.<br>
      <br>
<b>Mid Elves Own</b>: Say it out loud and it will will sound
similar to how the original stompbox name sounds.&nbsp; This model
excludes the sweepable mid-band EQ.&nbsp; Instead, the mid-band picks a
good place and leaves it fixed there.&nbsp; It is an intentional design
decision not to include the extra slider for mid sweep.&nbsp; This is
to maintain the simplicity of a generic interface for all models. The
Rakarrack Parametric EQ as well as MuTroMojo modules are capable of
providing a sweepable mid scoop or boost if desired.<br>
      </p>

<b>Fuzz</b>: 
The first kind of distortion to come in a stompbox.&nbsp; It makes
everything sound as you hear things while experiencing mild
electrocution from the chassis of a poorly grounded amplifier.&nbsp;
This does not capture any particular circuit, but rather summarizes an
era (although elements of the various different fuzz boxes were
considered in the design).&nbsp; The controls on this unit do not
follow the pattern of the stompbox models as fuzz originally was a 1 or
2 knob wonder.&nbsp; Here is the guide:<br>
<b>Level</b>: This does what it says<br>
<b>Gain</b>: This is mostly consistent with the name.&nbsp; This makes it
more distorted but at the same time the lows get cut from the input
increasingly as gain is increased.&nbsp; This is similar to how the
classic Fuzz Face behaves.<br>
<b>Low</b>: This has nothing to do with the low frequency EQ.&nbsp; This
controls the bias in the virtual "circuit".&nbsp; As you adjust up or
down, the waveform gets clipped increasingly asymmetrically in one
direction or the other. It has no effect at "0" setting, although the
clipping characteristic is naturally asymmetric.&nbsp; This setting can
make the fuzz sound rather "nasty", and is a good parameter to map to
the ACI to change dynamically.<br>
<b>Mid</b>: A mid-band EQ, but not like a normal mid-band EQ.&nbsp; This
one operates on the input before the distortion, and is tuned to act
like a stuck wah wah pedal.&nbsp; Settings less than zero cut mids from
the input mix, making the fuzz sound a little more "wooly".<br>
<b>High</b> This is a tone knob modeled according to the Big Muff tone
control.&nbsp; Positive numbers cut lows while boosting highs.&nbsp;
Negative numbers cut highs while boosting lows.<br>

      <p align="justify">Reverbtron</p>
      <p align="justify">A convolution Reverb and delay processor.<br>
      <br>
Reverbtron is based upon the engine of Convolotron (thus the name), but
takes into consideration that time-domain convolution has expensive
taste for CPU cycles.&nbsp; Convolving a reverb impulse response in
real time is impossible without the use of special hardware dedicated
to intensive DSP functions unless something in the impulse response is
sacrificed for lower processing requirements.<br>
      <br>
In the case of Reverbtron, the full shape of the response it preserved
from the head to the tail, but true replication of the frequency
response is sacrificed. In short, the "magic" actually happens in the
IR conversion utility used to convert the .wav IR file to a .rvb file
for Rakarrack.&nbsp; Various elements of the waveform are considered,
then the .rvb file is constructed as a list of pairs: Time, Reflection
Amplitude.&nbsp; This file is actually a plain text file, and you may
edit this file or generate your own custom files.&nbsp; In fact you
could use plain utilities such as bash scripting, perl, octave, scilab,
etc.&nbsp; Internally Reverbtron convolves this directly with the
signal using the time index to determine at what delay amount to
perform the multiplication.&nbsp; When Length is reduce, Reverbrton
simply subsamples the file at even intervals.&nbsp; As one can see, the
quality of the resultant reverb relies 100% on the construction of the
.rvb file.&nbsp; This has the side effect for enabling future
improvements to Reverbtron for users who install Rakarrack from their
distribution repository.&nbsp; Then they only need to download .rvb
files as the Rakarrack team improves the IR file processing.<br>
      <br>
Here are the parameters:<br>
<b>Wet/Dry</b>: Amount of dry signal to mix with the convolved
signal.&nbsp; Notice that the IR file defines the maximum
wetness.&nbsp; The Fade parameter fades the head end of the IR where
the amount of dry is defined.&nbsp; Usually this works well by mixing
all wet and setting fade until it appears there is silence at the
beginning for a duration equal to the incoming instrument's note attack
time.<br>
<b>Pan</b>: Fade the output more to the left or right.<br>
<b>Level</b>: Helps to compensate for louder and softer IR volume levels.<br>
<b>Damp</b>: Reduces high frequency content in the signal.&nbsp; This can help to tame poorly behaved IR files.<br>
<b>Fb</b>: Feedback.&nbsp; Feed output to input.&nbsp; Be careful as this
has the same sensitivity and character as microphone feedback.&nbsp;
Setting initial delay or fade to a modest level helps to create more of
a regenerative sound instead of feedback. Damp can be used to tame the
feedback as well.<br>
<b>Length</b>: This is measured in the number of points to process.&nbsp;
A length of 800 means that literally 800 reflections will be processed,
but it also means 800 multiplication and addition instructions will
happen for every frame.&nbsp; This is an indication of the amount of
subsampling performed on the IR file.&nbsp; Contrary to intuition, a
high number does not always make the reverb sound better.&nbsp; There
can be multiple "sweet spots" along the range, even with numbers less
than 300.<br>
<b>Stretch</b>: Want your IR to reverberate for a longer period of
time?&nbsp; Have a long one and want to shorten it?&nbsp; Stretch
changes the time base.&nbsp; A negative number shortens the IR, a
positive number makes it longer.&nbsp; You can stretch some IRs long
enough to create good discrete echoes; and very complex ones at that.<br>
<b>I. Del</b>: Initial Delay.&nbsp; This parameter delays the entire
reverb response.&nbsp; This is a way of thumbing your nose at
physics.&nbsp; You can create reverb effects that don't happen in the
real physical world.<br>
<b>Fade</b>: Reduce the level of the initial response of the IR.&nbsp;
This can be used to increase the wet level on an IR that contains much
of the direct response.<br>
<b>Safe</b>: Limits Length regardless of the setting.<br>
<b>User</b>: Browse for your own .rbv file.&nbsp; These files are
generated by invoking the rakverb command on a .wav format IR file.
"rakverb -i foo.wav" will generate a file called "foo.rbv" in the same
directory.&nbsp; This is the file you would want to load into
Reverbtron.<br>
      <br>
<b>Preset</b>: Rakarrack comes with several IR files already processed
and ready to go so you don't need to search the web looking for impulse
responses. <br>
