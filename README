This fork is from: 
    https://github.com/ssj71/rakarrack.git

The original was an incomplete attempt at merging the rkrlv2 plugins into the original rakarrack project.
This project is to complete the merging.

The current build is also a merging of autotools and cmake :).

To build rakarrack:
From base directory:

./autogen.sh
 mkdir Release
 cd Release
 ../configure CPPFLAGS=-DNDEBUG
 make
 make install (as root)
 
 To build rkrlv2 plugins:
 From base directory:
 
 mkdir buildlv2
 cd buildlv2
 cmake ..
 make
 make install (as root)
 

----------------------------------------------------------
Original from rkrlv2 project https://github.com/ssj71/rkrlv2.git

This project is the rakarrack effects ported to LV2 plugins.
The ports are done such that hopefully when rakarrack gets
an active maintainer these will get merged into the original
project. This was forked from version 6.1 (git commit 7dba0c4bccf88740c56867568d5b218b4a131499).

To install simply download the files and open a terminal in the extracted directory
and execute:

 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ..
 make
 sudo make install

This will also install carla project files. These project files are the plugin
equivalent of the preset banks in the standalone rakarrack version. These must be in
/usr/share/rkr.lv2/ for reverbtron or echotron to work properly. 

EFFECTS (X - done, W - won't do, + - done with missing features)
[X] Lineal EQ
[X] Compressor
[X] Distortion 
[W] Overdrive - exact same engine as distortion, but has fewer controls, presets were added to dist.
[X] Echo 
[X] Chorus 
[X] Phaser
[X] Analog Phaser 
[W] Flanger - this is identical to the chorus, presets from this will be included there
[X] Reverb 
[X] Parametric EQ 
[X] Cabinet Emulation - created new class for it 
[X] AutoPan/Stereo Expander 
[+] Harmonizer - still need to do midi mode version
[X] Musical Delay 
[X] Noise Gate - Direct copy of Steve Harris's Gate ladspa plugin
[X] WahWah 
[X] AlienWah 
[X] Derelict 
[X] Valve 
[X] Dual Flange 
[X] Ring 
[X] Exciter 
[X] DistBand 
[X] Arpie 
[X] Expander 
[X] Shuffle 
[X] Synthfilter 
[X] VaryBand 
[W] Convolotron - these require special input files, adding complexity. other excellent lv2 convolution engines already exist
[W] Looper - other good lv2 loopers exist
[X] MuTroMojo 
[X] Echoverse 
[X] CoilCrafter 
[X] ShelfBoost 
[X] Vocoder 
[X] Sustainer

Here is the original rakarrack README:


This app was born after an informal conversation about effects for guitar using GNU/linux.
The major part of this apps are discontinued or simply not have new versions after few
years. Josep Andreu say on the IRC chat "I can made an app based on the effects set 
hiden on code of ZynAddSubFX (by Paul Nasca Octavian). Some time after here is the
result of our work... 

This app has 42 effects: EQ Lineal, Compressor, Distortion, Overdrive, Echo, Chorus,
Phaser, Flanger, Reverb , Parametric EQ, Wah Wah, Alienwha, Harmonizer etc. 
The effects are procesed in cascade... The order of effects are configurable by the user. 
The state of rack can be saved as 'presets'. Sets of presets can be stored as 'banks'. 
The rack also has an integrated tuner and can receive MIDI control orders and can send MIDI 
notes to MIDI devices like synthesizers.

rakarrack is a JACK app.

The dependencies are:

libfltk1.1
libxpm
libjack100.0
libasound2
libsamplerate0
libsndfile1
aconnect  (part of Debian Package alsa-utils, name may vary on other distributions)
jackd
libxft2

If you want to compile you will also need the development packages:

libxpm-dev 
libfltk1.1-dev
libjack-dev
libsndfile1-dev
libsamplerate0-dev
libasound2-dev
libxft-dev

The name of the packages are typical of the naming convention for Debian-based distributions.
These can be a little different for each distro. Use your package manager search function
to find the equivalent package for your distribution.

If you are new to building packages from source code on Linux you will need a few other things
to set up a minimal development environment.
1) g++ (the compiler)
2) make
3) autotools-dev

Then if compiling from git repository, you need these too.
1) git-core (it is probable you have this if you're reading this README as it is likely you already used it to git the code).
2) autogen

If working from a graphical environment, you may wish to install 
qjackctl or patchage to aid with configuring jackd and connecting JACK clients.
