- Redefine the Bank Structure ( that ... will cause a lot of work ... )
- Arrange memory allocations of delay buffers in effects.
- Effect parameter count variable for each effect. 
- Possible virtual class effect, that will help for use more than one
- instance of each effect, but this has really problems of how to allocate
- the memory when the program start, and probably will be unusable with
- RT-Kernels.
- Class EffectLFOTempo and a new version of each effect that use LFO with
- this new class and other possible improvements on each one in order to
- differentiate. That is 7 new effects.
- All the widgets with images .. that will help for a better look, Timothy
