- Redefine the Bank Structure ( that ... will cause a lot of work ... )
- Arrange memory allocations of delay buffers in effects.
- Effect parameter count variable for each effect. 
- Possible virtual class effect, that will help for use more than one
- instance of each effect, but this has really problems of how to allocate
- the memory when the program start, and probably will be unusable with
- RT-Kernels.
- Class EffectLFOTempo and a new version of each effect that use LFO with
- this new class and other possible improvements on each one in order to
- differentiate. That is 7 new effects.
- All the widgets with images .. that will help for a better look, Timothy
- Anderson wanna help us with that.
- Complete list of assignable effect parameters to MIDI learn.

DSP TODO:
*This is a wish-list.  Some of these may not be done for 0.5.0.
- Reverse delay fade between old and new at wrap instead of ducking volume.  It will sound more smooth :)
- Improve sub-octave modulator for distortion.  Perhaps this can be a new effect.
- Dynamic echo:  Delay time changes with input signal dynamics....possible to get a "bouncing ball" effect.
- Vocoder
- CPU-friendly pitch shifter, flexible for Whammy effect
- Synth filters
- Sample/Hold modulator -- maybe just add to LFO effect using random sequence.
- 8-step sequencer effect.  Invoke phaser, flanger, wah and volume modulation.  Perhaps this can be a global variable with a GUI front-end?
- Ring modulator + arpeggiated carrier.
- Upsampling option for distortions and waveshapers.
- Distortion pedal & preamp modeling series:  Ibanez Tubescreamer, Thrash metal, Boss Metal Zone, DOD Death metal, MXR Dist +, some tube preamps ...  
- Infinite series:  i.e. Barberpole phaser, flanger and maybe some unique comb filter types.
