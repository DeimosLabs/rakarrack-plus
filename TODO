- Arrange memory allocations of delay buffers in effects.
- Complete list of assignable effect parameters to MIDI learn.

DSP TODO:
*This is a wish-list.  Some of these may not be done for 0.5.0.
- Reverse delay fade between old and new at wrap instead of ducking volume.  It will sound more smooth :)
- Improve sub-octave modulator for distortion.  Perhaps this can be a new effect.
- Dynamic echo:  Delay time changes with input signal dynamics....possible to get a "bouncing ball" effect.
- Vocoder
- CPU-friendly pitch shifter, flexible for Whammy effect
- Synth filters
- Sample/Hold modulator -- maybe just add to LFO effect using random sequence.
- 8-step sequencer effect.  Invoke phaser, flanger, wah and volume modulation.  Perhaps this can be a global variable with a GUI front-end?
- Ring modulator + arpeggiated carrier.
- Upsampling option for distortions and waveshapers.
- Distortion pedal & preamp modeling series:  Ibanez Tubescreamer, Thrash metal, Boss Metal Zone, DOD Death metal, MXR Dist +, some tube preamps ...  
- Infinite series:  i.e. Barberpole phaser, flanger and maybe some unique comb filter types.
