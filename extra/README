This directory contains three additional special effects banks:
    CC_03_SFX.rkrb
    CC_04_SFX.rkrb
    CC_05_SFX.rkrb

To use the SFX banks, copy and place in your user directory.
If rakarrack-plus is already started, then from the Bank Manager window,
press the R button. The SFX banks will then be listed in the drop
down User Banks menu. Otherwise the SFX banks will be automatically
loaded on program start.

Also included are additional individual effect presets in the file:
    InsertPresets.rkis

To use the InsertPresets.rkis, from the main window, File/Import Inserted Presets.
Then use the file chooser to select the InsertPresets.rkis file.
You must quit and restart. Then the new individual effect presets will
be listed with a * from the effect Preset menu.
